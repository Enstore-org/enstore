# -*- makefile -*-
# The file Setup is used by the makesetup script to construct the files
# Makefile and config.c, from Makefile.pre and config.c.in,
# respectively.  The file Setup itself is initially copied from
# Setup.in; once it exists it will not be overwritten, so you can edit
# Setup to your heart's content.  Note that Makefile.pre is created
# from Makefile.pre.in by the toplevel configure script.

# (VPATH notes: Setup and Makefile.pre are in the build directory, as
# are Makefile and config.c; the *.in files are in the source
# directory.)

# Each line in this file describes one or more optional modules.
# Comment out lines to suppress modules.
# Lines have the following structure:
#
# <module> ... [<sourcefile> ...] [<cpparg> ...] [<library> ...]
#
# <sourcefile> is anything ending in .c (.C, .cc, .c++ are C++ files)
# <cpparg> is anything starting with -I, -D, -U or -C
# <library> is anything ending in .a or beginning with -l or -L
# <module> is anything else but should be a valid Python
# identifier (letters, digits, underscores, beginning with non-digit)
#
# (As the makesetup script changes, it may recognize some other
# arguments as well, e.g. *.so and *.sl as libraries.  See the big
# case statement in the makesetup script.)
#
# Lines can also have the form
#
# <name> = <value>
#
# which defines a Make variable definition inserted into Makefile.in
#
# Finally, if a line contains just the word "*shared*" (without the
# quotes but with the stars), then the following modules will not be
# included in the config.c file, nor in the list of objects to be
# added to the library archive, and their linker options won't be
# added to the linker options, but rules to create their .o files and
# their shared libraries will still be added to the Makefile, and
# their names will be collected in the Make variable SHAREDMODS.  This
# is used to build modules as shared libraries.  (They must be
# installed using "make sharedinstall".)  (For compatibility,
# *noconfig* has the same effect as *shared*.)

# NOTE: As a standard policy, as many modules as can be supported by a
# platform should be present.  The distribution comes with all modules
# enabled that are supported by most platforms and don't require you
# to ftp sources from elsewhere.


# Example -- included for reference only:
# xx xxmodule.c

# This is for freeze to find the source of the included modules
