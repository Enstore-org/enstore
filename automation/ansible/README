The scripts in this directory are planned to replace the
existing 'farmlets' setup which is used along with enstore
Estart/Estop to push reload Enstore.

The idea is to use make_ansible.sh to create an ansible
inventory that contains host and server information from
the Enstore config, and use ansible playbooks to
stop/start/restart servers in a more dependable fashion.

In addition, this method should allow us to recognize
servers which have been removed from the Enstore config,
and turn these servers down appropriately by marking
them with tombstones.


So far, some progress has been made on generating the
inventory, but playbooks to start/stop/restart have
not been started.
