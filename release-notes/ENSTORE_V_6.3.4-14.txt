     Fix client behavior for dual stack host configurations.
    
    The previous implementation was allowing to reinit if application
    was running on dual stack host and sending to IPV4 server.
    This was noticed in encp application. The problem was that retires
    were sent on differnt ports, which violates enstores communutaion protocol,
    according to which retries must be sent on the same source port.

    Library manager does not delete assigned volume if mover fails to connect to client.
    
    There are 2 changes. One fixes the stated problem.
    The second change is to put mover request, coming from mover with bound volumes into postponed bound requests. If there is mover request processing thread running and serve postponed request in the current thread. Before this change the library manager was sending 'nowork' reply to mover in a hope that it would retry later and this retry would be processed ny library manager. This could and would result in expiration of dismount timeout at mover and unnecessary dismount of tape for which there was a potential request.
