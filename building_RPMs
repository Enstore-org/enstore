Enstore RPMS are currently built via two different methods,
via github actions and purpose-built containers.

Building via github actions:
This works to create el7 and el8 enstore rpms.

   1. go to https://github.com/Enstore-org/enstore and click on 'Actions'
      on the top row

   2. On the side bar some Actions are listed.  To build an el7 RPM
      use the Build-RPM action.  To build an el8 rpm use Build-RPM-Alma8

   3. Clicking on either of these two actions will change the browser
      space to show a usage history.  At the top of the browser page
      there is a "Run workflow" pulldown.  Pulling it down lets you
      choose which git branch to build the RPM from and another button
      that starts the build.  The rpm version of the resulting RPM is set 
      from the file 'rpm_version' in the top level directory of the
      branch you chose.  EDIT THIS FILE TO CHANGE release, version,
      and commit number.

   4. The resulting RPM will be produced as a build artifact.
      Download this from the github web site, then install,
      test, load to a repo for distribution. 

Building via container:
This method currently works for el8 enstore RPMS, el8 python-enstore RPMS,
and el8 mtx rpms.  The README for mtx at https://github.com/Enstore-org/mtx shows
in detail how to do this using podman for an mtx RPM. 
The steps to build the other RPMS are similar. In general:

    1. checkout the github repo example 
        git checkout https://github.com/Enstore-org/enstore.git

    2. change directory to 'enstore/.github/docker/<project>' directory
       for the product you want to build. 
       For el8, <project>=='alma8-build-enstore'
       For el8 enstore-python, needed to build el8 enstore,
                <project>=='alma8-build-python'
       For el8 mtx, see the README for https://github.com/Enstore-org/mtx

    3. Build the container image using podman, docker, or whatever
       container management system you prefer.  
       See https://github.com/Enstore-org/mtx/README for 
       an example of using podman.

    4. Start a container from the built image, and run
       the build script.

       For el8 enstore, the build script is located in the
       running container at  /data/build_enstore_rpm.sh
       For el8 enstore-python, build script is /data/run_build.sh
       For el8 mtx, build script is /data/build_enstore_mtx_rpm.sh

    5. Copy the resulting RPM out of the container from
       /root/rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/ and install, test, etc
